Fitts Law Controlled Experiment

Describe Fitts’s Law (Fitts’s 1954). Conduct and report a Fitts’s law experiment for aimed movement.
• First, choose an input modality. For example, touch, mid-air (Leap or Kinect), eye gaze, 3D
tracker, or mouse.
• Use the ISO 9241-9:2000 standard for designing your experimental tasks (multi-directional
tapping task; a description available here:
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f13f/1e47f528759fd992336ca2b08cca3072268f.pdf).
• Have 2 different target sizes and 3 different distances.
• You may use any programming language to design the experiment and collect data.
• Use the Shannon formulation of Fitts’s law.
• Find the regression coefficients after fitting your movement time data (HINT: use R, MATLAB, or
Python).
• Plot movement time over Index of Difficulty.
• Plot throughput over Index of Difficulty.
• You may submit the results of your own trials (or have more participants).

Deliverable: The application source code (preferably a link to a Bitbucket or GitHub repo). A brief report
describing the experimental method and analysis of the data collected (maximum 3 pages + figures).
